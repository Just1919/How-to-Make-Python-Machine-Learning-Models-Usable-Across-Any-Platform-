How to Make Python Machine Learning Models Usable Across Any Platform?
 

Python has become the go-to language for developing machine learning models, thanks to its powerful libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn. While Python models integrate seamlessly into Python applications, using them in other languages like C++, Java, or C# requires extra effort. You cannot simply call a Python function from another language as if it were native.
 
So, how can we make a Python model accessible to applications written in any language and running on any platform? There are two main strategies:
Exposing the Model via a REST API: The model is wrapped inside a web service using a framework like Flask, allowing any application capable of sending HTTP(S) requests to interact with it. This approach is easy to deploy, especially when using Docker containers.

Exporting the Model to ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange): ONNX is a platform-independent format that enables loading Python models in Java, C++, C#, and other environments using an ONNX runtime.
 Of course, if both the client application and the model are written in Python, these solutions are unnecessary.
In this article series, we will explore several practical scenarios:
*Saving and calling a trained Python model from a Python client
*Invoking a Python model from a non-Python client using a web service
*Containerizing a Python model (and web service) for seamless deployment
*Using ONNX to run a Python model in other programming languages

In this series of articles, we will cover these different points.
